Coding Test (fictitious)


***
NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES. However, feel free to state which third party libraries you might have used.

Here you'll find the code for a simple mobile app to browse cakes. 

Unfortunately, the developer who wrote this code is no longer employed by the company as we had some concerns over his ability. 

The project compiles but the app crashes as soon as it runs. The app loads a JSON feed containing a repeated list of cakes, with title, image and description from a URL, then displays the contents of the feed in a scrollable list. 

We would like you to fix the crash bug, ensure the functionality of the app works as expected (all images display correctly on the table, all text is readable) and performs smoothly (ideally, this should be done without third party libraries). You should also refactor, optimise and improve the code where appropriate to use platform best practises. 

Please note that we are not looking for perfection, but rather for a clean and pragmatic solution. This should include refactoring but shouldnâ€™t be over engineered. The test can be completed in 2-3 hours; howerever, this is a not a limit. Feel free to spend more time on it if you wish.

## solution

### Development Platform
iOS 11 and XCode 9.2
Please note that the solution is based on iOS 11.0 and developed in XCode 9.2.

### Technology used
This is a mixed code base, I try to refactor the existing solution and build up the new refactored code in Swift 4.0 and iOS 11 . Therefore following features are included.

- Swift 4.0
- New way of Json serialization with codable protocol by Swift 4.
- Objective-c
- Unit Testing (TDD)

### How to run the solution
Please checkout or clone or download the .zip file from the GIT. Use XCode 9 or 9.2  and iOS 11 to run the project.

### Area of improvment
I have not spent more than 3 hours for this assignment, if I spent few more hours I might provide few more unit tests. Although the assigment is not big enough but may be MVVM would be the better approch. Currently I try to implement the solution based on MVC-S (Model-View-Controller and Service) approach.
